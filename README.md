Objectives

To understand existing code for performing context-switches in the xv6 kernel

To implement a basic round-robin (RR) scheduler that compensates processes that relinquish the

CPU

To implement system calls that extract process states

To implement a user-level program that tests the basic compensation behavior of the scheduler

Overview

In this project, you‚Äôll be modifying the Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduler in xv6 so that processes can have different time-slice lengths and are ‚Äúcompensated‚Äù in different ways for the amount of time they are blocked (and thus cannot be scheduled).

in xv6 book.

In this document we:

1. specify how your new xv6 scheduler (CRR) must behave

2. specify the new system calls you must add

3. specify the simple user-level application you must write

4. describe the existing xv6 scheduling implementation

5. give suggestions for implementing this project

6. specify other requirements for completing this project

1) Compensated Round-Robin (CRR) Scheduler Requirements

The current xv6 scheduler implements a very simple Round Robin (RR) policy. For example, if there are three processes A, B and C, then the xv6 round-robin scheduler will run the jobs in the order A B C A B C ‚Ä¶ , where each letter represents a process. The xv6 scheduler runs each process for at most one timer tick (10 ms); after each timer tick, the scheduler moves the previous job to the end of the ready queue and dispatches the next job in the list. The xv6 scheduler does not do anything special when a process sleeps or blocks (and is unable to be scheduled); the blocked job is simply skipped until it is ready and it is again its turn in the RR order.

You will implement a new Compensated RR scheduler with three new features:

1. Different time-slice lengths (i.e., a different number of timer ticks) for different processes

2. Compensating processes for the amount of time they were blocked by scheduling those processes for a longer time-slice when they awake

3. Improving the sleep/wakeup mechanism so that processes are unblocked only after their sleep interval has expired, instead of on every 10 ms timer tick

1.1. Basic Time-Slices

In your RR scheduler, each process will have the same priority, but each process can have a time-slice of a different length, specified by the number of timer-ticks. After a process consumes its time-slice it should be moved to the back of the queue.

When a new process arrives, it should inherit the time-slice of its parent process and be added to the tail of the queue. The first user process should start with a time-slice of 1 timer tick. You will also create a system call, setslice(int pid, int slice) , to change the length of the specified process‚Äôs timeslice.

Scheduling is relatively easy when processes are just using the CPU; scheduling gets more interesting when jobs are arriving and exiting, or performing I/O.

whenever the xv6 10 ms timer tick occurs when a process exits when a process sleeps.

For simplicity, your scheduler should also not trigger a new scheduling event when a new process arrives or wakes; you should simply mark the process as ‚ÄúRUNNABLE‚Äù and move it to the tail of the queue. The next scheduling decision will be made the next time a timer tick occurs.

When a timer tick occurs, whichever process was using the CPU should be considered to have used an entire timer tick‚Äôs worth of CPU, even if it did not start at the previous tick. (Remember that a timer tick is different than the time-slice.)

In the base case for your scheduler (which will be modified in the text below), when a process sleeps and then wakes, its time-slice should be reset. For example, consider a process A that has a time-slice of 3 ticks, uses up 2 of those ticks and then blocks; when process A wakes and is scheduled the next time, A should be scheduled again for the full 3 ticks.

1.2 Compensating Processes for Blocking

Many schedulers contain some type of incentive for processes with no useful work to sleep (or block) and voluntarily relinquish the CPU so another process can run; this improves overall system throughput since the process isn‚Äôt wastefully holding on to the CPU, doing nothing. To provide this incentive, your scheduler will track how long a process sleeps and extend its next time-slice by a function of this amount.

Example 1: Base case. We‚Äôll start with the simplest case: a process A sleeps, wakes, is given compensation ticks, and A uses those compensation ticks the next time it is scheduled.

For example, if process A has a time-slice of 2 ticks and process B of 3 ticks and A sleeps for 3 timer ticks (at time 7), then when A wakes (at time 10), A is compensated for that sleep time by increasing its next time-slice by those 3 timer ticks; thus, at time 10, A is scheduled for a total of 5 ticks (2 ticks in its standard time-slice + 3 compensation ticks). In future intervals, A‚Äôs time-slice reverts back to its base 2 ticks. When a process uses compensation ticks, those ticks are marked in red; bold indicates the first tick of a time-slice.

timer tick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

scheduled A A B B B A B B B A A A A A B B B A A B

sleeping A A A

There are a few special cases to consider.

Example 2: Proper Sleep accounting. Make sure that when a process sleeps, it is given compensation ticks for the amount of time it was actually sleeping, not the amount of time it wasn‚Äôt scheduled.

For example, what happens if A sleeps for a very short time, but B has a very long time-slice? We don‚Äôt want A to be able to game the scheduler and get a large compensation time when A wasn‚Äôt going to be scheduled in that interval anyways; we want to compensate A only for the time it was actually sleeping.

If we modify our previous example so A sleeps for only 1 timer tick, then when B‚Äôs time-slice expires and A is rescheduled at time 10, it is given only 1 compensation tick.

timer tick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

scheduled A A B B B A B B B A A A B B B A A B B B

sleeping A

Example 3: No accumulation of compensation ticks. What happens if A doesn‚Äôt use its compensation ticks before it sleeps again? We don‚Äôt want A to be able to accumulate a huge number of compensation ticks for future use.

If we modify the first example (where A blocks for 3 ticks and thus acquires 3 compensation ticks), but A blocks again at time 13 after using only 1 of those compensation tickets, A will lose the 2 compensation ticks it did not use; however, A will obtain new compensation tickets based on how long it blocks the next time (1 compensation tick acquired at time 13 and used at time 18 in this example).

interval 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

scheduled A A B B B A B B B A A A B B B A A A B

sleeping A A A A

Consider example 1 without B:

interval 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

scheduled A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A

sleeping A A A

When A sleeps from intervals 4 ‚Äì 6 it will acquire 3 compensation ticks that are then used from 9-11.

The boldface A‚Äô s designate that this is considered a new scheduling time-slice for A.

Example 5: Multiple Processes. In many workloads, there will be multiple processes that are blocked. All of these processes will be acquiring compensation ticks for the time they are blocked. This isn‚Äôt a special case; just ensure that you aren‚Äôt assuming only one process is sleeping or blocked at a time.

These mechanisms are far from perfect to prevent gaming, but they are good enough for this project.

You could imagine many different policies that would fix more problems but might be more complicated.

1.3 Improving the Sleep/Wake Mechanism

Finally, you need to change the existing implementation of sleep() syscall. The sleep syscall allows processes to sleep for a specified number of ticks. Unfortunately, the current xv6 implementation of the sleep() syscall forces the sleeping process to wake on every timer tick to check if it has slept for the

2) New system calls

You‚Äôll need to create several new system calls for this project.

2. int getslice(int pid) . This returns the time slice of the process with pid , which must be a positive interger. If the pid is not valid, it returns -1.

3. int fork2(int slice) . This routine is exactly like the existing fork() system call, except the newly created process, which should begin with the specified time-slice length. Thus, fork() could now be implemented as fork2(getslice(getpid())) since by default the child process inherits the time-slice length of the parent process. If slice is not positive, then fork2() should return -1.

4. int getpinfo(struct pstat *) . Because your scheduler is all in the kernel, you need to extract useful information for each process by creating this system call so as to better test whether your implementation works as expected.

To be more specific, this system call returns 0 on success and -1 on failure (e.g., the argument is not a valid pointer). If success, some basic information about each process will be returned:

struct pstat { int inuse[NPROC]; // whether this slot of the process table is in use (1 or 0) int pid[NPROC]; // PID of each process int timeslice[NPROC]; // number of base ticks this process can run in a timeslice int compticks[NPROC]; // number of compensation ticks this process has used int schedticks[NPROC]; // total number of timer ticks this process has been scheduled int sleepticks[NPROC]; // number of ticks during which this process was blocked int switches[NPROC]; // total num times this process has been scheduled };

Most of the fields should be self-explanatory, but we describe some in more detail. compticks , schedticks , sleepticks , and switches are accumulative, so they will increase during the lifecycle of the

process and only get reset when the process dies.

The schedticks field is the total number of timer ticks the process has been scheduled; that is, ticks should usually be incremented exactly once for exactly one process when a timer tick occurs.

The switches field should be incremented whenever a process is scheduled (it should not be incremented for each timer-tick within that time-slice); the switches field should be incremented even if there is only one process ready process (e.g., if process A finishes its time-slice, but because there are no other ready processes, A is scheduled again, then switches should still be incremented). Switches should also be incremented when a process is scheduled after waking (even if its previous time-slice was not used up entirely); it should not be incremented separately for compensation ticks. (Remember switches are marked in bold in the examples above.)

For example, if process A in example 3 calls getpinfo in interval 15, it should get:

A: timeslice = 2; compticks = 1; schedticks = 6; sleepticks = 4; switches = 3.

B: timeslice = 3; compticks = 0; schedticks = 9; sleepticks = 0; switches = 3.

You can decide if you want to update your pstat statistics whenever a change occurs, or if you have an equivalent copy of these statistics in ptable and want to copy out information from the ptable when getpinfo() is called.

The file should be copied from ~cs537-1/projects/scheduler/pstat.h .

3) New User-Level Applications

To demonstrate that your scheduler is doing at least some of the right things, you will create two new user-level applications named loop and schedtest.

First, to have a dummy job with known behavior, you will need to implement a user-level program, loop .

Second, schedtest runs two copies of loop as child processes, controlling the time-slice and sleep time of each child. The schedtest application takes exactly 5 arguments in the following order: prompt&gt; schedtest sliceA sleepA sliceB sleepB sleepParent

schedtest spawns two children processes, each running the loop application. One child A is given

initial timeslice length of sliceA and runs loop sleepA ; the other B is given initial timeslice length of

sliceB and runs loop sleepB .

Specifically, the parent process calls fork2() and exec() for the two children loop processes, A before B, with the specified initial timeslice;

After sleeping, the parent calls getpinfo() , and prints one line of two numbers separated by a space:

printf(1, ‚Äú%d %d ‚Äú, compticksA, compticksB) , where compticksA is the compticks of process A in the pstat structure and similarly for B.

The parent then waits for the two loop processes by calling wait() twice, and exits.

(Note that a time tick of 10ms is a lot of time for a fast CPU, hence it is likely that the calls to fork and exec will finish and the parent will call wait before any child process is scheduled; therefore, you don‚Äôt need to worry about the parent process interfering with the scheduling queue.)

Assume that all the arguments are reasonable and small positive numbers like the example above. We will not test your implementation of schedtest extensively; the purpose of it is primarily for you to understand how to test your round-robin scheduler. You are welcome to write more user applications to test other aspects of the scheduler: round-robin behavior, different time-slice lengths, process setting timeslice value of itself, etc.

4) xv6 Scheduling Details

Most of the code for the scheduler is localized and can be found in proc.c . The header file proc.h describes the fields of an important structure, each of struct proc in the global ptable .

You should first look at the routine scheduler() which is essentially looping forever. After it grabs an exclusive lock over ptable, it then ensures that each of the RUNNABLE processes in the ptable is scheduled for a timer tick. Thus, the scheduler is implementing a simple Round Robin (RR) policy.

A timer tick is about 10ms, and this timer tick is equivalent to a single iteration of the for loop over the ptable in the scheduler() code. Why 10ms? This is based on the timer interrupt frequency setup in xv6.

You should examine the relevant code for incrementing the value of ticks in trap.c .

When does the current scheduler make a scheduling decision? Basically, whenever a thread calls sched() . You‚Äôll see that sched() switches between the current context back to the context for scheduler() ; the actual context switching code for swtch() is written in assembly and you can ignore

those details.

When does a thread call sched() ? You‚Äôll find three places: when a process exits, when a process sleeps, and during yield() . When a process exits and when a process sleeps are intuitive, but when is yield() called? You‚Äôll want to look at trap.c to see how the timer interrupt is handled and control is

For sleep and wake-up, the current xv6 implementation of the sleep() syscall has the following control flow:

When each sleeping process is scheduled but finds it hasn‚Äôt slept long enough, it puts itself back to sleep again (see the while-loop of sys_sleep() ).

As mentioned previously, this implementation causes the process that invoked syscall sleep() to falsely wake inside the kernel on each tick, and as a result, the process won‚Äôt get the compensation it deserves. To address this problem, you should change wakeup1() in proc.c to have some additional condition checking to avoid falsely waking up the sleeping process (e.g. checking whether chan == &amp;ticks , and whether it is the right time to wake up, etc). Feel free to add more fields to struct proc to help wakeup1() decides whether the processing it is going to wake up really needs to be wakened up at this moment .

5) Tips

We recommend writing very small amounts of code and testing each change you make (e.g., by running forktest ) rather than implementing too much functionality at one time.

In proc.c , add a queue-like data structure to hold the current scheduling queue. A linked list might be the easiest to implement, though other data structures work as well. It is much easier to deal with fixed-sized arrays in xv6 than allocating kernel memory. It is fine to continue to assume that xv6 can handle some maximum number of active processes. Remember to initialize this data structure correctly and add the init user process to the queue so it can be scheduled and run.

When a process gets allocated, its scheduler-related PCB fields should be initialized correctly, and it should be put to the tail of the queue. When a process exits, it needs to be removed from the queue. Add in the new syscalls. We recommend adding them early so you can write user programs to test whether your queue is working as expected or not. You are an expert at adding system calls after surviving P2. This time, you‚Äôll need to understand how to fill in the structure pstat in the kernel and pass the results to user space and how to pass the arguments from user space to the kernel. Good examples of how to pass arguments into the kernel are found in existing system calls. In particular, follow the path of read() , which will lead you to sys_read() , which will show you how to use argptr to obtain a pointer that has been passed into the kernel.

The scheduler() function in proc.c is the main place where modifications go. Instead of iterating over the ptable, your scheduler should peek at the current head of the scheduler queue. If its timeslice (+ compensation ticks if applicable) has not been used up for this scheduling cycle, keep scheduling it. Otherwise, move to the next process in the queue and put the previous head to the tail. Do the accounting of necessary counters properly. After making these changes, give yourself a pause and write small user programs to test whether your scheduler robin-robins over the queue correctly and gives each process the correct number of ticks per cycle.

6) Other Requirements

We will do and test this entire project with compiler optimizations turned off. Make sure in your Makefile CFLAGS variable contains -Og and not -O2 .

To make your life easier and our testing easier, you should run xv6 on only a single CPU. Make sure in your Makefile CPUS := 1 .

Copy the provided pstat.h from ~cs537-1/projects/scheduler/pstat.h .

Remember to run the xv6 environment, use make qemu-nox . Type ctrl-a, release, followed by x to exit the emulation. There are a few other commands like this available; to see them, type ctrl-a, release, followed by h.

When debugging, remember that gdb can be quite useful!

6.1 Code Development

First, use the ‚Äúfs‚Äù command to make sure no one can snoop about your directories. Let‚Äôs say you have a directory where you are working on project 2, called ‚Äú~remzi/p2‚Äù. To make sure no one else can look around in there, do the following:

‚Äòcd‚Äô into the directory

check the current permissions for the ‚Äú.‚Äù directory (‚Äú.‚Äù is the current dir)

make sure system:anyuser (that is, anybody at all) doesn‚Äôt have any permissions

check to make sure it all worked

If at any point you see the directory has permissions like this:

that means that any user in the system can read (‚Äúr‚Äù) and list files (‚Äúl‚Äù) in that directory, which is probably not what you want.

6.2 Testing

We recommend making sure that your scheduler can handle a large range of jobs. If you can run usertests and forktests , your scheduler is probably fairly robust (though unfortunately, it might not be

implementing the correct policy). We strongly recommend you to first write a few small user programs to test various aspects of this project, such as getting and setting the timeslice or a process, round-robining over the queue with the correct number of ticks for each process per cycle, and having processes sleep and wakeup. Ensure correct behavior from these tests before moving on to our tester.

As always, we provide a set of public tests under ~cs537-1/tests/p4/ . On any CSL machine, use cat ~cs537-1/tests/p4/README.md to read more details about how to list the tests and how to run the tests in batch. Note that there will be a small number of hidden test cases (20%).

6.3 Handin

You can use up to 3 slip (late) days across all the projects throughout this semester; for example, you can use 1 slip day on three separate assignments or 3 slip days on a single assignment (or other combinations adding up to a total of 3 days). If you are using slip days on this project, you must create a file called slip_days with the full pathname ~cs537-1/handin/login/p4/slip_days. The file should contain a single line containing the integer number of slip days you are using; for example, you can create this file with ‚Äúecho 1 &gt; slip_days‚Äù. We are not requiring a slip_days folder anymore. We will simply grade the latest handin. You must only copy your code into the corresponding slip directory: ~cs537-1/handin/login/p4/slip1, ~cs537-1/handin/login/p4/slip2, or ~cs5371/handin/login/p4/slip3 .

To hand in code, create a src/ directory under ontime or slipX and put all the files under your xv6/ under that src/ folder, just like in P2.

Each project partner should turn in their joint code to each of their handin directories. Each person should place a file named partners.txt in their handin/p4 directory, so that we can tell who worked together on this project. The format of partners.txt should be exactly as follows:

It does not matter who is 1 and who is 2. If you worked alone, your partners.txt file should have only one line. There should be no spaces within your first or last name; just use spaces to separate fields.

To repeat, both project partners should turn in their code and both should have a handin/p4/partners.txt file. Suppose you are submitting to slip1, the final directory tree should look like:
